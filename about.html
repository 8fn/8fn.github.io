                    <p>
                      Hi everyone, i'm <b>Tanjil Shahid Khan</b>, a
                      <b>17-year-old</b> who likes to stay active and healthy. I
                      love going to the <b>gym</b> , <b>taking walks</b>, and
                      <b>traveling</b> to explore the world around me. I love
                      listening to <b>music</b>, specially
                      <b>rock, metal, hardcore and phonk</b>. Furthermore, I'm
                      passionate about <b>programming</b> and love to learn more
                      about it whenever I can. I love the idea of being able to
                      create and transform the world with my skills and
                      knowledge. And of course, I can't forget that I love to
                      eat everything, especially steaks, chicken with french
                      fries and rice, which is my favorite classic meal. For me,
                      simplicity is the key to appreciating the good things in
                      life. In summary, I'm an
                      <b>active, curious, music and technology enthusiast</b>
                      who loves to enjoy the simple things in life. I believe
                      that each person is unique, and I hope to continue
                      exploring and learning more about myself and the world
                      around me.

                    <h3>
                      My journey in programming and interest in technology
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      My journey in programming started when I was just
                      <b>13 years old</b>. From a young age, I have always had a
                      passion for <b>technology</b> and was fascinated by the
                      power of <b>programming</b>. My very first program was in
                      <b>JavaScript</b>, and it was a bot for a game interface
                      called Steam. I specifically used <b>Node.js</b> to create
                      it. As I delved further into programming, my interest
                      grew, and I started learning Python. In 2018, I created my
                      <b>first website</b> using <b>Python</b> and a framework
                      called <b>Flask</b>. One of the pages on my site allowed
                      users to enter their height, which was then saved in a
                      <b>database</b> using <b>SQLite3</b>. Once the user
                      submitted their height along with their email address,
                      they would receive an email showing the average height of
                      all users in the database. Before starting my 10th year in
                      the technical course of management and programming of
                      computer systems, I also learned <b>C++</b> to ensure that
                      I could keep up with the course material. During my 10th
                      year, I was introduced to <b>PHP</b> by my brother who
                      works with this language frequently. Currently, I have a
                      <b>solid</b> foundation in programming and am
                      <b>comfortable working</b> with
                      <b>Node.js, Laravel, JavaScript, C++, PHP, and MySQL</b>
                      for creating databases. I use <b>Linux</b> every day to
                      program and complete my work, and frequently use
                      <b>Git</b> to manage my programs. My journey in
                      programming has been a continuous learning process, and I
                      am always excited to explore new technologies and expand
                      my knowledge in this ever-evolving field. I hope to
                      continue growing and contributing to the world of
                      technology through my skills and passion for programming.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I started my academic journey at <b>Torrinha school</b> in
                      <b>Oporto</b> during <b>primary school</b>, and then moved
                      on to <b>Irene Lisboa</b> basic school, which is part of
                      the Carolina Michaelis group, also in Oporto. So far, I
                      have not repeated any years and I have always had
                      <b>reasonable grades during my basic education</b>.
                      <b>The 10th grade</b> was a turning point for me in terms
                      of academic performance. It was my <b>best year</b> so
                      far, with the highest grades I had ever achieved.
                      <b
                        >I was in the honor roll for all periods with an average
                        of 17.</b
                      >
                      In the programming course of the technical course in
                      management and programming of computer systems in the 10th
                      grade, I started learning
                      <b>algorithms and data structures using C++</b>. In the
                      11th grade, we learned
                      <b
                        >PHP and SQL for database creation, and we used UML to
                        plan and structure our work.</b
                      >
                      In operating systems classes, I achieved maximum grades
                      due to my early knowledge of <b>Linux</b>. Currently, in
                      my 12th grade, I am working on my professional aptitude
                      test using
                      <b>NodeJS and the Express framework with MySQL</b>. You
                      can find my project

                      <b>16.40</b>, ranging from 0 to 20, and I achieved grades
                      between 18 and 20 in various technical subjects. So far, I
                      have never failed any subjects or modules, although I
                      struggle with mathematics. On the other hand, I have
                      always enjoyed learning English and can easily understand
                      it, but I have difficulty with the pronunciation.

                      <b>software development and consulting</b>. The company
                      specializes in implementing software for their clients and
                      is located in Maia, Portugal. Vanguarda works with
                      <b>databases</b>
                      and develops software for their clients. They use the
                      <b>SQLServer</b> tool to store all of their clients'
                      information in a database. During my internship, I worked
                      in the <b>support department</b>, where records were
                      created with all the information related to clients'
                      requests. These records were then sent to the development
                      department, which developed solutions according to each
                      client's needs.
